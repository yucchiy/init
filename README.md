$ init
======

Minimum items for repositories. It is just for me now. This repositry include minimum items I always used my OSS projects.

## Usage

    $ git clone git@github.com:sota0805/init.git
    $ cd init
    $ ./init

## Todo

I would like it to be a like Yomen. 

Example:

    $ something init
    Cloning into 'init'...
    remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
    remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    Checking connectivity... done.
